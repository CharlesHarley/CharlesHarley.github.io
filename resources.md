Articles, videos and web sites that I've found the most inspirational and informative to me as a software engineer. In no particular order.

- [Clean Coders](http://cleancoders.com/ "Clean Coders") videos by Robert C Martin AKA Uncle Bob - Brilliant series designed to help you be a better software engineer. Well worth the cost. Your future self will thank you!
- [On Being a Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/ "On Being a Senior Engineer") - Insightful article about what it means to be a senior engineer.
