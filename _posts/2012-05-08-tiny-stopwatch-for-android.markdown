Today I released my first personal Android app into the Google Play Store. It is a stopwatch app that supports multiple stopwatches and is designed to work across phones and tablets. It is also built from the ground up to fit in with the new design paradigms used in the latest versions of Android such as the action bar. I also just wanted a better looking stopwatch app.
