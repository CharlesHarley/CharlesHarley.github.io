Just finished reading 'Application Security for the Android Platform: Processes, Permissions, and Other Safeguards' by Jeff Six.

The book is essentially a high level introduction to application security when programming for the Android platform but does go into sufficient depth to give you a decent understanding. It covers the following key topics:

- Risk assessment
- Android permissions system
- Storing data securely
- Securing server communication

Having studied computer science at university the last two key topics were familiar but it is amazing how much you forget! By far the most useful chapters were on the Android permissions systems. I don't have sufficient knowledge on application security to properly review the book (hence why I bought it). However, at just under 100 pages it is a good introduction to the topic and very easy to read.
